# seq2seq-en-fr
End-to-end English-French translation starting with an LSTM seq2seq model, later upgraded to a Transformer for faster, more accurate translations. Includes preprocessing, training, and an interactive Streamlit inference app.

Users should refer to the relevant README.md file within the appropriate folder for further information on either the LSTM or Transformar architecture.
